# Erlang, a purely functional programming lang... Wait, what?!

TL;DR: This is more of a rant than anything else.
       Nothing to see here, move along.

Some time ago I ran across [Chris Smith][t:cjsmithie]'s
[very good overview of using Docker Compose to setup an Erlang system][blog:docker-compose].
The post is well written and I wholeheartedly advise you to spend a while
on it if you're getting into reproducible deployments or testing distributed systems.
To the point, though. Chris writes:

What immediately caught my attention was _purely functional programming_.
When referring to Erlang. Let me repeat:
_purely functional programming_ when referring to Erlang.

I'm pretty functionally far from admitting Erlang is purely functional.
I've been doing Erlang for a couple of years now and it makes
me feel entitled (yet, it does) to have an opinion.

-   Erlang is not pure.
-   Erlang is not Haskell.
-   Erlang is purely functional if and only if we're talking about its sequential subset.
    Even then it's a stretch.

The moment you `spawn` a process the first time, or use `!` (bang) to send a message,
or access a public ETS table in a concurrent fashion, or cause a transition
in a `gen_fsm` you can kiss your purity goodbye,
you've just caused a side effect in the system - possibly without knowing it!
Why use Erlang if you're not intending to do any of these?
With its location transparency, built-in distribution and effective
multicore scheduling it's the perfect tool for networked,
high-throughput systems.

Is not being _purely functional_ good? Is it bad?
Is it really important? Am I really mad about it or just pretending?
The answers are: no, no, no, and yes, I'm just pretending!
I just wanted to point this small fact out in a humorous
way - [like Lisp][wiki:difference-pure-impure], Erlang is an _impure_ functional language.
And by all means don't take this post as any kind of attack on Chris - I have
no reason for that whatsoever, I don't even know him,
we live in completely different countries,
maybe even on different continents.

Let me elaborate on the comparison to Haskell.
As far as I know Haskell, which is a wee bit, though I'm far from being an expert,
there are sections of code, _islands of purity in a sea of imperative code_
(sorry, I liked this this quotation so much I just had to steal
it from [Frege's README](https://github.com/Frege/frege)),
which you can call into from the side-effectful driver.
You know they're pure, it's guaranteed.
The type system won't allow for any violation.
Every type of side effect is encapsulated into some monad.
This is completely on the contrary to what you get in Erlang.

In Erlang, any kind of side effect can be hidden behind a function call.
Modifying a public ETS table? Can be hidden. Sending a message? The same.
The caller won't know.
Even more so - it's considered good style, it's encouraged to build functional
interfaces hiding these implementation details.
Concurrency is so cheap it (almost) doesn't make a difference!
Each function call may block the caller (and cause it to free the scheduler),
each call might return a different value given the same parameters if called multiple times.
It's still possible (and should be common!) to split a system into pure
and impure parts, but there are no guarantees.

In my opinion, Erlang's closest cousin in the family of more popular
languages is Python. Why?

- Type system. _Pass me anything and I'll try to figure out what to do with it._
- Syntactic support for common data structures.
- Not necessarily the most consistent standard library
  (probably not the case for Python 3 anymore),
  but a wealth of open source tools available.
- Pattern matching: Python has some, Erlang has more.
- Despite all of the above, ease of use and development speed.
- Flat learning curve!
  Few concepts needed to start, a lot can be learnt on the go
  when already doing useful work.

There's one difference though: Python has the [GIL][wiki:gil],
while Erlang a preemptive userspace scheduler easily handling millions
of concurrent entities spread across multiple CPUs.
And did I mention distribution and location transparency yet? ;)

Uff... Why did I even write this post?
